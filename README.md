## üìå Project Description

This project is more than just a keyboard, it‚Äôs a **compact, powerful, and personal input device** designed to make your daily digital workflows smoother, faster, and a lot cooler. Built with an ESP32 at its heart, this macro keyboard brings together customizability, minimalism, and modern embedded tech, all in one tight, stacked PCB sandwich.

It‚Äôs the kind of project that was born out of passion for coding, electronics, and clean user experience. Whether you‚Äôre a dev, video editor, gamer, or creative multitasker, this macro pad is your digital sidekick. You define the workflows, it delivers the clicks.

| üî• Feature                  | üí¨Description                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üéõÔ∏è **7 Keys + 1 Knob**      | Minimal but powerful. Map shortcuts, volume, brightness, or anything you want to each key and the rotary knob.  |
| üß† **6 Custom Layouts**     | Multiple layers? You got it. Define up to 6 layouts ‚Äî fully programmable to suit any app or workflow.           |
| üíæ **EEPROM Save**          | Remembers the last brightness level even after reboot. No more resetting your backlight every time.             |
| üí° **LED Backlight**        | Soft, adjustable lighting to match your vibe or workspace. No RGB spam ‚Äî just practical and clean.              |
| üí§ **Auto Sleep Mode**      | No device connected? It sleeps after 3 mins to save power. Smart and energy-aware.                             |
| üîã **2A Fast Charging**     | Charges quick, runs long. Swappable battery design so you can pick the capacity that fits your needs.          |
| üî© **Stacked PCB Design**   | Neat and compact ‚Äî no 3D case needed. Layered PCBs give structure *and* style.                                 |
| üß† **BLE HID Connectivity** | Acts as a Bluetooth HID device ‚Äî plug and play across Windows, macOS, Linux, even mobile.                      |

###### This project uses an BLE HID by default (based on the current code for generic esp32). Feel free to modified it however you want!
